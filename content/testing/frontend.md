# Frontend Testing (Microfrontends)

Usually question arises how to test frontend?

## Unit Tests

- Business logic unit tests

## Component Tests

- e.g. click on button should open a date picker

## Integration Tests

- Most of the tests should be written at this level
- Test/verify the accepted user scenarios
- CDC from frontend to backend?

## E2E Tests

- Recommended to use Cypress

## Best Practices

- Test as a user; never test underlying implementation details; so, one can easily switch the technology
