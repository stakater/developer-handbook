# Foundations

The Foundations section outlines the design principles upon which the rest of the guide builds.

## Provide Request-Ids for Introspection

Include a `Request-Id` header in each API response, populated with a UUID value. By logging these values on the client, server and any backing services, it provides a mechanism to trace, diagnose and debug requests.

## Divide Large Responses Across Requests with Ranges

Large responses should be broken across multiple requests using `Range` headers
to specify when more data is available and how to retrieve it. See the
[Heroku Platform API discussion of Ranges](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#ranges)
for the details of request and response headers, status codes, limits,
ordering, and iteration.

# Require Secure Connections

Require secure connections with TLS to access the API, without exception.
It’s not worth trying to figure out or explain when it is OK to use TLS
and when it’s not. Just require TLS for everything.

Ideally, simply reject any non-TLS requests by not responding to requests for
http or port 80 to avoid any insecure data exchange. In environments where this
is not possible, respond with `403 Forbidden`.

Redirects are discouraged since they allow sloppy/bad client behaviour without
providing any clear gain.  Clients that rely on redirects double up on
server traffic and render TLS useless since sensitive data will already
 have been exposed during the first call.
 
## Separate Concerns

Keep things simple while designing by separating the concerns between the
different parts of the request and response cycle. Keeping simple rules here
allows for greater focus on larger and harder problems.

Requests and responses will be made to address a particular resource or
collection. Use the path to indicate identity, the body to transfer the
contents and headers to communicate metadata. Query params may be used as a
means to pass header information also in edge cases, but headers are preferred
as they are more flexible and can convey more diverse information.

## Support ETags for Caching

Include an `ETag` header in all responses, identifying the specific
version of the returned resource. This allows users to cache resources
and use requests with this value in the `If-None-Match` header to determine
if the cache should be updated.
